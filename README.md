## üìä Project Title: EDA: FEMA Public Assistance and Disaster Declaration Data  

### üöÄ Project Overview  
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) project utilizes publicly available FEMA data to examine trends in disaster declarations and public assistance funding. The analysis identifies key disaster types, funding distribution, and the states receiving the most federal assistance. Insights from this analysis can inform decision-making for emergency management companies and contractors interested in bidding for disaster support projects.  

The project includes:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw FEMA datasets for analysis.  
- **Data Analysis**: Investigating trends in disaster declarations, funding allocations, and seasonal patterns.  
- **Geographical Visualizations**: Creating choropleth maps to visualize funding distributions across states.  
- **Business Recommendations**: Providing insights on when and where to submit bids for disaster response contracts.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Python**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `folium`, `datetime`  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data exploration and analysis  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations  
- **Folium**: For interactive geographical visualizations  
- **Warnings**: To suppress warnings during analysis

### üìà Key Insights  

1. **Most Frequently Declared Disaster Types**:  
   - **Severe storms, hurricanes, and floods** were the most frequently declared disaster types.  
   - **Biological incidents** saw a significant spike, notably in **2020**.  

2. **Funding Distribution Across Disaster Types**:  
   - **Biological incidents** and **hurricanes** received the highest levels of federal funding.  
   - **Floods, wildfires, and severe storms** also received significant funding but less than biological incidents and hurricanes.  
   - **Average funding** varied, with hurricanes and biological incidents receiving the most per incident.  

3. **States Receiving the Most Funding**:  
   - **California, Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, New York,** and **Louisiana** were the top recipients of federal funding.  
   - These states have a higher frequency and severity of incidents, including hurricanes, wildfires, and severe storms, which explains their large funding allocations.  

4. **Seasonal Disaster Trends**:  
   - **Spring (March)** and **early fall (September)** showed the highest number of disaster declarations, making them optimal months for submitting proposals.

### üéØ Outcome  
This project demonstrates the ability to:  
- Analyze trends in disaster declarations and funding distributions over time.  
- Identify which states and disaster types receive the most funding.  
- Create interactive geographical visualizations using Folium to display funding distributions.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for companies bidding for disaster response projects.
